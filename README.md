# Identifying Missing Values

In this exercise, we will explore one of the most common problems that data analysts and scientists encounter: missing values. We will work with the `nyc-ticket-violation` dataset to see how often missing values occur and what impact they might have on our analysis. We will also learn how to identify missing values and handle them appropriately.

## Dataset

The `nyc-ticket-violation` dataset contains information on parking and traffic violations issued in New York City. It includes information such as the date and time of the violation, the location of the violation, the type of violation, and the make and model of the vehicle.

## Dismissing Tickets without Make of Car

In addition to identifying missing values, we will also explore a hypothetical scenario where tickets can be dismissed if the license plate, state, and/or street name are all present, but without requiring the make of the car. We will use the same `nyc-ticket-violation` dataset to work through this scenario.

## Conclusion

Missing values can have a significant impact on our analysis, and it's important to handle them appropriately. By working through this exercise and exploring different scenarios, we will gain a better understanding of how to identify missing values and how to handle them in a way that allows us to make meaningful insights from our data.
